# 🐢 About Me
I’m a developer living in Switzerland (and a graphic designer). I have 6 repos on GitHub with one of them being **dead. dead as hell.** I make content on YouTube even though it was a ***wwwhhhhiiiiiiiilllllllleee*** since I’ve uploaded. I'm being on Discord all day able to respond to messages (not actually all day). I speak english, french and german fluently. (atleast I think so).
My discord is ```kevadesu#9686```
My revolt is ```@kevadesu```
